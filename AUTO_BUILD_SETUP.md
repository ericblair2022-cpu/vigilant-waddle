# AUTOMATIC BUILD SETUP - NO TERMINAL NEEDED

## I CANNOT DIRECTLY UPLOAD BUILDS FOR YOU
I can only modify code files. I cannot run terminal commands or upload builds to App Store Connect.

## SOLUTION: GitHub Actions (Automatic Builds)

### Step 1: Push Code to GitHub
1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push your code there

### Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets
In your GitHub repo settings > Secrets:
- `EXPO_TOKEN`: Your Expo access token
- `APPLE_ID`: Your Apple ID email
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`: App-specific password

### Step 3: I'll Create GitHub Action File
This will automatically build and upload when you push code.

## ALTERNATIVE: Use Expo Web Dashboard
1. Go to expo.dev
2. Login with your account
3. Create new project
4. Upload your code via web interface
5. Trigger build from web dashboard

## CURRENT STATUS
- Your app is configured correctly
- EAS configuration is ready
- You need someone to run the build commands OR set up GitHub Actions

Would you like me to create the GitHub Actions workflow file?
